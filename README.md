Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

JDK 11 or later (for Spring Boot)
Node.js and npm (for React frontend)
MySQL or H2 (depending on the database setup)
Postman or any API testing tool (optional, for testing backend API)
Installation
Backend (Spring Boot)
bash
Copy code
cd employee-management-system/backend
Create a .env file or modify application.properties for database setup:

For MySQL:

properties
Copy code
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/employee_db
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=yourpassword
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.jpa.database-platform=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL8Dialect
For H2 (in-memory database):


bash
Copy code
./mvnw spring-boot:run
This will start the backend on http://localhost:8080.

Frontend (React)
Navigate to the frontend directory:

bash
Copy code
cd ../frontend
Install the frontend dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Set up the environment variables for API URLs (in .env file or src/api.js):

env
Copy code
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8080/api
Start the React development server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
This will start the frontend on http://localhost:3000.
